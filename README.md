SAWSS and Sawss editor is a personal project.

Sawss is an intuitive front-end framework for HTML5 development.

Sawss is an extension of CSS3, adding contextual rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.

### Edit /dist files locally

You'll want to clone the Sawss repo first and install all the dependencies. You can do this using the following commands:

* npm install -g grunt-cli
* npm install grunt --save-dev
* npm install
* npm install grunt-postcss autoprefixer-core csswring

Add a `less` file watcher

Then just run `grunt build` and the `/dist` files will be generated from the compiled `/less/sawss.css` file.  

> If I missed anything or if you have issues let me know. This works for my current Frankenstein.
