Sawss is an intuitive front-end framework for HTML5 development.

Sawss is an extension of CSS3, adding contextual rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.

### Edit source files locally

> I need to update the next version before the below will work. I am leap frogging!

You'll want to fork/clone the Sawss repo first and install all the dependencies. You can do this using the following commands:

You will need `bower` and `npm`

* bower install sawss
* npm install -g grunt-cli bower
* npm install grunt-postcss --save-dev
* npm install grunt-postcss autoprefixer-core csswring

Run a `less` watch to compile the `sawss.css` file

Then just run `grunt build` and the `/dist` files will be generated from the compiled `sawss.css` file.  

> There may be a better way to npm, grunt, bower; if I missed anything or if you have issues let me know. This works for my current Frankenstein.
